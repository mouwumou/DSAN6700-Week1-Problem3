.. py:function:: send_email(sender, recipient, subject, body)

   Send an email using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).

   This function creates an email message with the provided sender, recipient,
   subject, and body, and sends it via SMTP using a local server running on
   localhost at port 1025.

   Args:
       sender (str): The email address of the sender.
       recipient (str): The email address of the recipient.
       subject (str): The subject line of the email.
       body (str): The body of the email message. If None is provided,
           no message body will be sent.

   Raises:
       SMTPException: If there is any error in connecting to the SMTP server
           or sending the email.

   Example:
       To send an email from 'test@example.com' to 'recipient@example.com'
       with a subject and body, you can use the following code:

       >>> send_email('test@example.com', 'recipient@example.com', 'Hello', 'This is a test email.')

   Notes:
       This function connects to an SMTP server at 'localhost' on port 1025,
       which is often used for testing with local SMTP servers such as
       `MailHog` or `smtp4dev`. For real-world usage, replace the server
       configuration with a valid SMTP host and port.

   Returns:
       None
